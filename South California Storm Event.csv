Some heavy rain did spill over the Santa Ana Mountains, resulting in flooding in the community of El Cerrito, in western Riverside County.  Over 4 inches of rain caused moderate to heavy damage to 8 homes and and minor damage to 10 others.  Farther north in the Victor Valley of San Bernardino County, heavy rains caused local flooding in many communities.

In Costa Mesa, two large pine trees were snapped in half. In San Diego County, tree limbs were broken in the Ramona area. The first rain band dropped a half to one inch of rain on Orange County during the late afternoon and evening of January 10, resulting in street flooding in several locations. Between 2 and 4 inches of rain fell during the early morning hours of January 11 as a much stronger rain band moved slowly east across the area.  In Garden Grove, the roof of one building collapsed under the weight of the pooled rainwater and another business was flooded with 15 inches of runoff. In San Juan Capistrano, runoff  from a hillside flooded an underground parking garage to a depth of  5 feet, destroying 15 cars.  Pacific Coast Highway was flooded between Sunset Beach and Seal Beach and also in Costa Mesa.

On 9/2/01, thunderstorms formed over all the mountains. Rainfall of over 2 inches in one hour was observed. Flooding and mudslides across major roadways occurred between Barton Flats and Forest Falls, from Oak Glen south to Cherry Valley  and into the Banning Pass near Beaumont, and around Lake Cuyamaca. Frequent lightning was recorded, with lightning detection sensors indicating about 60 strikes per hour. Numerous small fires were started in the National Forests. A group of four hikers climbing Stonewall Peak in the San Diego County Mountains encountered lightning and heavy rain. Two of the hikers stopped short of the peak and took shelter. Two others continued on to the lookout area which is surrounded by a metal railing. The 53 year old man was struck in the head by lightning and died. The other, a 13 year old boy, was knocked unconscious but survived. Small hail was observed by many. A downdraft from a thunderstorm knocked a tree onto a house in Beaumont. 

On 9/3/01, afternoon thunderstorms formed over the San Bernardino Mountains and the Apple Valley. Two boys in an open field in Apple Valley were hit by lightning. The 13 year old was eating from a cup of noodles when lightning hit him in the head and exited his groin area. He was pronounced dead some time later after CPR efforts were unsuccessful. The 9 year old boy standing next to him was holding a metal tool  at the time. He felt the lightning pick (him) up""", and then awoke lying on the ground unable to feel his legs.

A cold low pressure system known as an inside slider slammed southern California from the north with heavy snow, widespread thunderstorms, and gusty winds. The storm first struck the high desert areas of the Apple and Yucca Valleys bringing with it heavy thundersnow and strong north winds. The cold air then filtered into the inland empire, dropping snow as low as 1000 ft. Residents woke to snow in places like Temecula, Elsinore, and Murrieta. In those places, snow was up to 3 inches deep. The hills surrounding Riverside and Moreno Valley were also coated with a blanket of snow. Snow was so heavy in Yucaipa and Calimesa that large tree limbs came crashing down all across town. The same was true in the mountains, where locals reported upwards of 2 to 3 feet of snow. Wind caused problems all across southern California. Some trees came down on powerlines, cutting power to more than 64,000 southern California Edison customers. In San Diego County, snow was reported as low as Ramona. Even by lunch time, temperatures at the coast were only in the low 40s. Snow lingered on the ground at low elevations for days following the storm as daytime temperatures were slow to recover.",293,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Blowing dust reduced visibility to near zero along interstate 215 and the Ramona Expressway. Elsewhere, high winds in the San Bernardino Mountains near Rim Forest forced vehicles to slide across and off icy stretches of highway 18. Large trees fell onto homes and cars in the Lake Arrowhead area. Small, wind-driven wildfires were reported along interstate 15 near Mormon Rocks and the Cajon Pass. |The second high wind event occurred during the early morning hours of the 7th and the 8th.

As the main 500 mb low pressure center passed through Nevada, an upstream vort max moved out of Northern California and into the Southern California coastal waters, causing a stronger, secondary 500 mb low pressure center to develop near San Diego. This system was then able to pick up additional moisture as it began to take an over-water trajectory and intensify. The heaviest precipitation was confined to San Diego County where low-level cyclogensis and upper level forcing were strongest. Evaporative cooling and cold air advection caused the temperature to drop steadily throughout the day, and the snow level fell from 5500 feet around sunrise to near 1000 feet by mid day. Only a dusting of snow had been reported through noon, but by 1:00 pm, heavy snow was was falling and sticking across a wide area from Ramona to the Anza Borrego Desert. Thundersnow and blizzard-like conditions in the inland valleys and mountains of San Diego County stranded more than 500 hundred vehicles on local roadways and forced the closure of Highway 78, Highway 76, and Interstate 8.

Rainfall ranged from one-half of an inch up to around 4 inches, including a record 1.71 inches at Lindbergh Field on the 18th (July 18 single-day and July monthly total). The San Diego River at Fashion Valley had 2 crests above monitor stage, 7.7 feet on the 18th and 8.8 feet on the 19th. The heavy rain resulted in a debris flow in the burn scar of Silverado Canyon, as well as flash flooding in Moreno Valley, Perris, and La Mesa on the 19th and a wet microburst in Tierrasanta on the 18th. The rain also caused the first Los Angeles Angels baseball game rain-out since 1995, and a rare 2-hour rain delay at the San Diego Padres baseball game. Over 2000 lightning strikes reported on July 18, some starting small brush fires. Microburst wind damage occurred in Tierrasanta, along with additional damage from a haboob in the Anza Borrego SP and wind damage from a thunderstorm in Palm Desert.",131,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
