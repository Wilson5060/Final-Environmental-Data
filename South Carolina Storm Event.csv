The most intense thunderstorm produced tennis ball size hail in the Shadowmoss subdivision in West Ashley, while golf ball size hail fell in Meridian in McIntosh County. We also received other reports of quarter size hail and wind damage. Two storms in western Charleston County encountered boundaries and began to rotate, prompting Tornado Warnings.

A stalled front offshore combined with deep tropical moisture streaming northwest into the area ahead of a strong upper level low pressure system to the west and Hurricane Joaquin well to the east. This led to historic 4-day rainfall totals with  widespread amounts of 15-20 inches and localized amounts over 25 inches, mainly in the Charleston Tri-County area.  Flash flooding was prevalent for several days and eventually led to Flash Flood Emergencies for Charleston, Berkeley, Dorchester and Colleton counties during the morning hours of October 4, 2015.  Many people had to be rescued by emergency personnel while significant damage occurred to numerous properties and roads. Tides were also historically high due to the recent perigean spring tide and persistent onshore winds, exacerbating and prolonging flooding across the area and along the coast, especially in downtown Charleston. ||The most significant flooding occurred in areas along and near smaller creeks and streams, especially those that were tributaries to larger rivers such as the Edisto, Ashley, Cooper, and Santee. In addition to impacting thousands of homes and businesses, flood waters also damaged many roads and bridges in the area, causing significant travel disruptions that lasted for multiple days. Furthermore, some roads and bridges were so badly damaged that it will likely take weeks to months to repair.||As of 12/31/15, a SCEMD report indicated an estimated total monetary damage of $4,533,337 in Berkeley County, $18,213,860 in Charleston County, $2,030,879 in Colleton County and $6,186,909 in Dorchester County for the flood event. Total costs for each county have been divided equally to each flash flood report within that particular county for this flood event and are considered estimates only.",465

The controlled burn jumped from its intended location due to a shift in winds and a wildfire developed in a very dry portion of the forest. All total, approximately 1,600 acres of land were burned either directly from the wildfire or from suppression activities. The Francis Marion National Forest was very dry due to a lack of rain and record setting temperatures and very dry air created an environment supportive of the development and spread of wildfires.","Rainfall across southeast South Carolina was well below normal January-May 2019, with rainfall totals in most areas around 40 to 50 percent of normal. The Charleston International Airport (KCHS) measured just 7.71 inches of rain through the end of May, the driest January-May period on record. Similarly, Downtown Charleston (KCXM) measured only 5.10 inches of rain which ranked as the 2nd driest January-May period on record. ||To make matters worse, a record setting heat wave occurred starting on May 25th. Daily record high temperatures were either tied or broken each day at KCHS from May 25-30. Also, the first 100 degree day in May on record occurred on May 26th and high temperatures reached or exceeded 100 degrees for 4 consecutive days (May 26-29), which ranks as tied for the second longest 100 degree streak on record for any time of year. Coincident with this heat wave was a period of low humidity. Relatively humidity values routinely dropped to less than 30 percent, causing rapid drying of soils and plants. ||The effect of this period of little or no rainfall and record setting temperatures was a rapidly developing drought. The June 4th issuance of the US Drought Monitor (which highlights conditions during the last week of May) showed a large introduction of Severe Drought (D2) across nearly all of southeast South Carolina.

A county official reported two waterspouts associated with Hurricane Idalia moving onshore at Folly Beach between the 1700 Block of East Ashley Avenue and the Morris Island Lighthouse, resulting in no discernable damage.","Idalia first developed into a tropical depression across the western Caribbean Sea near the Yucatan Peninsula on August 26th before slowly gaining strength and becoming a tropical storm on August 27th. The storm then began to take a northward track the next day, passing the western tip of Cuba while gaining strength. On August 29th, Idalia was upgraded to a Category 1 hurricane early in the morning, then intensified to a Category 2 hurricane later in the day while tracking across the southeast Gulf of Mexico. Idalia then continued to strengthen as it accelerated northward on August 30th, passing off the Florida Suncoast as a Category 2 hurricane, before rapidly intensifying to a major Category 4 hurricane while approaching the Big Ben region of Florida across the northeast Gulf of Mexico. Idalia then made landfall at 645 AM EST on August 30th about 20 miles south of Perry, Florida as a Category 3 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 125 mph and a minimum central pressure of 949 mb. ||Idalia continued to track north-northeast after landfall, eventually turning northeast and weakening to a strong tropical storm while traversing southeast Georgia and southeast South Carolina late morning through evening hours on August 30th. Minimum surface pressures of 985.4 mb at Hinesville, GA (KLHW), 984.6 mb at Charleston City, SC (CHLS1) and 983.3 mb at the Savannah Entrance Light across nearshore coastal waters were recorded as Idalia tracked across the local area. Idalia then continued tracking northeast away from the region, exiting into the western Atlantic just south of Myrtle Beach, SC during early morning hours on August 31st. Idalia then began an eastward path across the western Atlantic, becoming a post tropical cyclone by late day, before continuing a track toward Bermuda for the next couple days. ||Across southeast Georgia and southeast South Carolina, the main impacts associated with Idalia included tropical storm force winds, heavy rain, storm surge and tornadoes. Tropical storm force winds gusts up to 40 to 69 mph (highest near coastal areas) aided with heavy rains led to numerous trees and power lines down across southeast Georgia and southeast South Carolina. On August 30th, a maximum sustained wind of 44 knots and peak wind gust of 60 knots was recorded at the Tybee Island South sensor (XTYE) in southeast Georgia while a maximum sustained wind of 41 knots was recorded at the Folly South End (XFSE) sensor and a peak wind gust of 58 knots was recorded at the Beaufort (XBUF) sensor in southeast South Carolina. Additionally, a maximum sustained wind of 49 knots and a peak wind gust of 60 knots was recorded at the Savannah Entrance Light (XSEL) across nearshore coastal waters. One indirect injury occurred due to tropical storm winds when a vehicle collided with a fallen tree in Effingham County, GA. No fatalities occurred due to tropical storm winds across the area.||Storm total rainfall amounts generally ranged between 1 to 2 inches across coastal areas of southeast Georgia, 2 to 4 inches along and east of Interstate 95 across southeast South Carolina and 4 to 9 inches across far inland areas of southeast Georgia and areas west of Interstate 95 in southeast South Carolina. A peak storm total rainfall of 9.05 inches was recorded near Smoaks, South Carolina while a peak storm total rainfall of 8.28 inches was recorded near Metter, Georgia. Heavy rains across inland areas led to instances of flash flooding with numerous roads washed out, water entering a few structures and 2 vehicles being swept off roadways. No injuries or fatalities occurred due to heavy rain/flash flooding across the area.||Idalia's passage was coincident with high tide, resulting in storm surge generally between 2 to 3.5 ft along the southeast South Carolina coast. A maximum tide level of 3.47 ft MHHW (9.23 ft MLLW) was observed at the Charleston Harbor (CHTS1) tide gauge at 718 PM EST on August 30th, making it the 5th highest tide on record for that location. Damage/inundation from storm surge crossing roads, entering properties and flooding structures was most notable along the Charleston, Colleton, and Beaufort County coasts, mainly in the McClellanville, Isle of Palms, Mount Pleasant, Folly Beach, Downtown Charleston, Edisto Island and Saint Helena Island communities/areas. Peak storm surge (3.5 ft) was noted along areas adjacent to the Ashley River and the Charleston Harbor in Charleston County. Further south, a maximum tide level of 1.95 ft MHHW (9.45 ft MLLW) was observed at the Fort Pulaski (FPKG1) tide gauge at 654 PM EST on August 29th, which was consistent with water levels that typically do not produce significant impacts along the southeast Georgia coast. No injuries or fatalities occurred due to storm surge across the area.||A total of 6 tropical related tornadoes occurred across southeast Georgia into southeast South Carolina within rainbands associated with Idalia. One short-lived EF0 tornado occurred in Liberty County across southeast Georgia, mainly producing tree damage. Another EF0 tornado occurred in Charleston County across southeast South Carolina, downing/uprooting trees and producing minor roof damage to homes and vehicles in Mount Pleasant. Two waterspouts also shifted onshore along the northern end of Folly Beach in Charleston County, but were short-lived and caused no discernable damage. Two tornadoes occurred in Berkeley County across southeast South Carolina, one being an EF1 tornado that snapped/uprooted numerous trees along its path in the Francis Marion Forest and the second being a short-lived EF0 tornado that flipped a vehicle over on a highly traveled road in Goose Creek, SC. Two injuries resulted from the flipped vehicle. No fatalities occurred due to tornadoes across the area.",187

In a 2-hour period, between 1:29 PM and 3:29 PM, 5.97 inches of rain fell.","A low pressure system developed over the Gulf of Mexico and tracked northeast across the Florida Peninsula in the early morning hours of December 17th, then strengthened across warm Atlantic waters while passing along the Southeast Coast, bringing impacts in the form of major coastal flooding, flash flooding, strong winds and high surf across southeast South Carolina. ||Major coastal flooding occurred along the southeast South Carolina coast, with the Charleston Harbor Tide Gage (CHTS1) reaching a preliminary value of 9.86 ft MLLW on December 17th, the 4th highest tide on record at this location. This also set the record for the highest non-tropical related high tide level at this location. Daily rainfall amounts of 3.92 inches at Downtown Charleston (KCXM) and 3.25 inches at North Charleston (KCHS) climate sites set daily rainfall records. Elsewhere, rainfall amounts generally fell within the 2 to 4 inch range across inland areas of southeast South Carolina and 4 to 6 inches across Beaufort and Jasper Counties of southeast South Carolina. The largest rainfall amounts occurred with a quasi-stationary rainband that set up across northern Charleston County, where localized rainfall totals between 10 and 16 inches were reported. A  peak daily rainfall of 16.32 inches was measured at a personal weather station on Old Cemetery Road, near McClellanville, South Carolina.||The combination of major saltwater flooding and heavy rainfall/flash flooding associated with the passing low pressure system led to at least 78 rescues being made by firefighters in the Charleston area, mostly from vehicles stalled on flooded streets. Dozens of cars and trucks were also abandoned in roadways across the area. Unfortunately, one fatality occurred when a 72-yr old female became trapped in a fully submerged vehicle during a flash flooding event in Mount Pleasant, South Carolina. The combination of major saltwater flooding and high surf also led to moderate/major beach erosion across Isle of Palms, Folly Beach, and Kiawah Island, as well as damage to piers/docks and several beach front properties/homes.||During rapid intensification, the low pressure system displayed central pressures lowering from 1010 mb at 7 AM December 16th to 988 mb at 7 PM December 17th, a 22 mb drop in a 36-hr period. This led to a strong pressure gradient across the region as well as December minimum sea-level pressure records being set at several coastal sites along the Southeast Coast, including at Charleston, SC (KCHS). Observed wind gusts were generally between 40 and 50 mph along the coast, with a peak wind gust of 57 mph at Folly Beach, South Carolina and a peak wind gust of 65 mph along with a maximum sea wave height of 27 ft at Buoy 41004 offshore, which led to numerous trees and power lines down across the area.
